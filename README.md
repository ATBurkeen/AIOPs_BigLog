## 📣 Introduction
Biglog is a unified log analysis framework that utilizes a pre-trained language model as the encoder to produce a domain-agnostic representations of input logs and integrates downstream modules to perform specific log tasks. This is the official repository for paper 《Biglog: Unsupervised Large-scale Pre-training for a Unified Log Representation》, published at IWQoS 2023.
## ✨ Implementation Details
In pre-trained phase, 8 V100 GPUs (32GB memory) is used. The model is pre-trained with 10K steps of parameters updating and a learning rate 2e-4. Batch size is 512 and the MLM probability is 0.15. Warm-up ratio is 0.05 and weight_decay is 0.01. For the fine-tuning of specific analysis tasks, since only a few parameters in classification heads or pooling layers need updating, only 1 or 2 V100 GPUs (16GB memory) are utilized and the fine-tuning process is within 2 epochs of traversing the dataset. Depending on the complexity of different tasks, learning rate is set between 0.5e-4 and 10e-4 and the batch size is 8 or 32. 
## 🔰 Installation

**pip install**
```
$ pip install transformers
```

### Use Biglog to acquire log embeddings
(1) load Biglog tokenizer
```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
biglog_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('/pretrained')
```
(2) load pre-trained Biglog
```
from transformers import BertModel
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('/pretrained')
```
(3) tokenize log data
```
tokenized_data=biglog_tokenizer(YOUR_DATA,padding = "longest",truncation=True,max_length=150)
```
(4) get embeddings
```
out=model(torch.tensor(tokenized_data['input_ids']))
log_embedding=out[0]
```
